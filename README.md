# PSYNTH

Psynth (a name that has already been used by someone else) means "pulse synth".
It is a software synthesizer that I initially wrote to try out a very simple
algorithm:
Each voice produces a perfect pulse wave, and the output signal is just all voices XORed together.

In the current version psynth has two programs (selectable via MIDI):
1. The sum of one pulse wave for each voice
2. The XOR-based program described above

## Licensing

For now I chose the GPLv2.

## Downloading
